This repository contains a VBScript code example demonstrating a subtle bug related to the `IsEmpty` function's behavior with empty strings.  The `IsEmpty` function in VBScript is intended to check if a variable has been assigned a value.  However, it behaves unexpectedly when checking empty strings.  The provided example showcases this issue and offers a solution. The bug is that `IsEmpty()` incorrectly returns true when it should return false for empty strings.
